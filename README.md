# Exploratory-Data-Analysis---Bank-Customer-Data

The implementation of our preliminary data analysis begins with an exploration of our four datasets. Using python in our Jupyter notebooks allows us to load our datasets into our environment and transform each dataset into a pandas dataframe. The pandas library enables us to perform manipulations on our dataframes and create visualizations.
